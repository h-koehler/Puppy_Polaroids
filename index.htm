            <h2>LABRADOR RETRIEVER</h2>
            <h3>Origin</h3>
            <p>The Labrador Retriever originated from Newfoundlound and was bred as a sporting and hunting dog. As a
                sporting/hunting dog, it retrived game and waterfowl on land and water, and served as a companion for
                hunters. The breed dates back
                to the 1830s, where St. John's water dogs (bred by European settlers in Newfoundlound) were bred with
                British hunting dogs to create the Labrador.</p>
            <h3>Characteristics</h3>
            <p>The Labrador is a medium-large breed that ranges from 55-80 lbs in weight and 21.1-24.5 in in height. The
                Lab's coat can be three colors: black, yellow, and chocolate. As a gun dog specifically bred for water
                retrieving, the Labrador has fully webbed paws, an otter-like tail, and a water-resistant double coat
                (which helps the dog stay warm when in the water in the winter). These traits combined make the Lab an
                inately strong swimmer. The Lab also has a soft mouth, which allows it to carry game and waterfowl
                without damaging it.</p>
            <p>The Labrador's personality is friendly, energetic, and playful. They bond well with their family and are
                socialable with neighbors. They are a high-energy breed and require lots of exercise to keep them
                mentally and physically fit. The Lab is also highly intelligent, has the ability to take initiative, and
                self direction, making it an excellent service dog.</p>
            <h3>Today</h3>
            <p>Today the Lab is considered the most popular breed in the world, and is the most popular dog by ownership
                in Canada, New Zealand, ad the UK. They have also been the number one dog in the US for 31 years. This
                is because, in addition to being a great family dog, the Lab's disposition makes it an excellent service
                dog. In fact, Labs are the most popular breed of assistaance dog in the US and Australia. Approsimately
                60-70% of all guide dogs in the US are Labradors. This makes sense seeing as Labs have the highest
                success rate in completing guide dog school. The Labrador is also widely used by police and other
                officials for their detection and working abilities. </p>
