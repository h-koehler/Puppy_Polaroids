    <h3>Origin</h3>
    <p>The Labrador Retriever originated from Newfoundlound and was bred as a sporting and hunting dog. As a
        sporting/hunting dog, it retrived game and waterfowl on land and water, and served as a companion for
        hunters. The breed dates back
        to the 1830s, where St. John's water dogs (bred by European settlers in Newfoundlound) were bred with
        British hunting dogs to create the Labrador.</p>
    <h3>Characteristics</h3>
    <p>The Labrador is a medium-large breed that ranges from 55-80 lbs in weight and 21.1-24.5 in in height. The
        Lab's coat can be three colors: black, yellow, and chocolate. As a gun dog specifically bred for water
        retrieving, the Labrador has fully webbed paws, an otter-like tail, and a water-resistant double coat
        (which helps the dog stay warm when in the water in the winter). These traits combined make the Lab an
        inately strong swimmer. The Lab also has a soft mouth, which allows it to carry game and waterfowl
        without damaging it.</p>
    <p>The Labrador's personality is friendly, energetic, and playful. They bond well with their family and are
        socialable with neighbors. They are a high-energy breed and require lots of exercise to keep them
        mentally and physically fit. The Lab is also highly intelligent, has the ability to take iniative, and
        self direction, makiSg it an excellent service dog.</p>
