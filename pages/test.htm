            <h2>LABRADOR RETRIEVER</h2>
            <h3>Origin</h3>
            <p>The Labrador Retriever originated from Newfoundlound and was bred as a sporting and hunting
                dog. As a
                sporting/hunting dog, it retrieved game and waterfowl on land and water, and served as a
                companion for
                hunters. The breed dates back to the 1830s, where St. John's water dogs (bred by
                European settlers in
                Newfoundland) were bred with British hunting dogs to create the Labrador.</p>
            <h3>Characteristics</h3>
            <p>The Labrador is a medium-large breed that ranges from 55-80 lbs in weight and 21.1-24.5 in in
                height. The
                Lab's coat can be three colors: black, yellow, and chocolate. As a gun dog specifically
                bred for water
                retrieving, the Labrador has fully webbed paws, an otter-like tail, and a
                water-resistant double coat
                (which helps the dog stay warm when in the water in the winter). These traits combined
                make the Lab an
                innate strong swimmer. The Lab also has a soft mouth, which allows it to carry game and
                waterfowl
                without damaging it.</p>
            <p>The Labrador's personality is friendly, energetic, and playful. They bond well with their
                family and are
                sociable with neighbors. They are a high-energy breed and require lots of exercise to
                keep them mentally
                and physically fit. The Lab is also highly intelligent, has the ability to take
                initiative, and self
                direction, making it an excellent service dog.</p>
            <h3>Today</h3>
            <p>Today the Lab is considered the most popular breed in the world, and is the most popular dog
                by ownership
                in Canada, New Zealand, ad the UK. They have also been the number one dog in the US for
                31 years. This
                is because, in addition to being a great family dog, the Lab's disposition makes it an
                excellent service
                and therapy dog. In fact, Labs are the most popular breed of assistance dog in the US
                and Australia and
                have the highest success rate in competing guide dog school. Approximately 60-70% of all
                guide dogs in
                the US are Labradors. The Labrador is also widely used by police and other officials for
                their detection
                and working abilities, such as drug and explosive detection, water rescue, and search
                and rescue.</p>

            <h2>BERNESE MOUNTAIN DOG</h2>
            <h3>Origin</h3>
            <p>The Bernese Mountain Dog originated from Switzerland and the Swiss Alps. Their German name
                Berner
                Sennenhund is derived from Senne which means “alpine pasture” and Hund (hound/dog). They
                are one of four
                breeds of Sennenhund. The other three are: Greater Swiss Mountain Dog, Appenzeller
                Mountain Dog,
                Entlebucher Mountain Dog. The Bernese Mountain Dog is a descendant of working dogs taken
                to Switzerland
                by invading Romans more than 2,000 years ago.</p>
            <p>As a working dog, these dogs were used as all purpose farm dogs. They were used to protect
                farms from
                predators, drive cattle to and from their pastures, transport carts of milk and cheese
                (earning the
                title “Cheese Dogs”), and as companions to their handlers.</p>
            <h3>Characteristics</h3>
            <p>The Bernese Mountain Dog is a large, heavy dog that ranges from 75–120 lbs in weight and
                23-27.5 in in
                height. It has a double coat; a short undercoat and a long, silky outcoat. The outer
                coat is
                tri-colored; it is black with a white chest and rust-colored markings on the front of
                legs, sides of
                mouth and chest, and above the eyes. Because of their coat, these dogs shed regularly.
                The Bernese
                Mountain Dog is also considered a dry-mouthed breed, which means it produces less drool
                than other big
                dogs.</p>
            <p>The Bernese Mountain Dog is good-natured, self-assured, and affectionate. They are patient
                and docile
                dogs that are gentle with children. These dogs are eager to please and are devoted to
                their family, so
                they do not do well when left alone for too long. These dogs also need regular activity
                and exercise to
                stay mentally and physically fit.</p>
            <h3>Today</h3>
            <p>Today the Bernese Mountain Dog is one of the most popular dog breeds in the US, ranking at
                #22 in 2022.

            <h2>SHIBA INU</h2>
            <h3>Origin</h3>
            <p>The Shiba Inu is an ancient dog that originated in Japan in 300 BC. The Shiba was bred to
                hunt and flush
                out small game, such as birds and rabbits, in the mountainous regions of Japan. This is
                also where its
                name is derived from; “shiba” means brushwood in Japanese, and “inu” means dog.</p>
            <p>After World War II, the Shiba almost became extinct due to food shortage and a post-war
                distemper
                epidemic. Because of this, today’s Shiba Inu is a combination of the three surviving
                bloodlines: the
                Shinshu Shiba from Nagano Prefecture, the Mino Shiba from the former Mino Province, and
                the San’in Shiba
                from Tottori and Shimane Prefectures.</p>
            <h3>Characteristics</h3>
            <p>The Shiba Inu is a small, muscular dog that ranges from 17-23 lbs in weight and 13.5-16.5 in
                in height.
                It has a thick double coat and a bushy tail that curls over its back. The outer coat is
                stiff and
                straight and the undercoat is soft and dense. Their coat comes in four colors, red,
                sesame, black and
                tan, and cream. Most also have markings known as “urajiro” (underside white).</p>
            <p>From the Japanese breed standard, the Shiba Inu has spirited boldness, good nature, and a
                feeling of
                artlessness. The Shiba can do well with other dogs, kids, but, as with all dogs,
                requires adequate
                socialization from a young age. Shiba’s are highly intelligent and can be very
                headstrong. Training can
                be difficult and requires a patient and consistent handler. The Shiba can be a vocal
                dog, and has a
                distinguishing “shiba scream”.</p>
            <h3>Today</h3>
            <p>Today the Shiba In is the number one companion dog in Japan, and is growing in popularity in
                the United
                States (currently ranked 43rd). The Shiba Inu has had a significant presence in online
                culture since at
                least 2010. For example, the creation of Doge, an Internet meme from 2013, and the
                cryptocurrency
                Dogecoin, which is named after the meme.</p>

            <h2>GOLDEN RETRIEVER</h2>
            <h3>Origin</h3>
            <p>The Golden Retriever is a sporting/gun dog that originated from Scotland in the 19th century.
                The breed
                was created by Sir Dudley Majoribanks, who crossbred Flat-coated Retrievers with Tweed
                Water Spaniels,
                and some other British dog breeds. Majoribank’s goal was to create a dog that could
                retrieve birds
                either in water or land and from far distances. The Golden Retriever also served as a
                companion dog to
                their owners and families. </p>
            <h3>Characteristics</h3>
            <p>The Golden Retriever is a strong, medium-sized dog that ranges from 20-24 in in height and
                55-75 lbs in
                weight. It has a thick double coat that has a medium length outer coat that can be flat
                or wavy, and a
                dense undercoat that provides weather resistance. The coat can vary greatly, from light
                cream to
                mahogany. Because of its origin, the Golden Retriever is a water-loving dog and is a
                strong swimmer.</p>
            <p>The Golden Retriever is intelligent, gentle, playful, and affectionate. Goldens are known for
                being an
                excellent family pet, as they are generally extremely tolerant of children and are
                devoted to their
                owners. They are also eager to please and are among the most obedient dog breeds,
                consistently winning
                in standardized obedience, agility, and field trials. However, they do require a patient
                and consistent
                trainer and a fenced-in yard during off-leash exercise, as their curiosity can cause
                them to be easily
                distracted. They also require regular mental stimulation and challenges in order to
                maintain mental and
                physical fitness.</p>
            <h3>Today</h3>
            <p>Today the Golden Retriever is one of the most popular companion dogs in the UK, US,
                Australia, and
                Canada. In the US, it ranked 3rd in popularity and is regularly in the top 5. The Golden
                Retriever is a
                regular competitor at dog shows, can be trained as guide dogs and therapy dogs, and may
                compete in
                obedience trials and other dog sports. </p>
